1. what did we do? - We learned about the basic rules of computational thinking and how it could be applied to real life situations.
2. what did you learn? I learned that computers don't process and respond to information the same way as humans, and that you have to make extremely specific commands for the computer to process and follow. This can also be applied to real life, as vague information is unacceptable and unrespectful to others, and makes it harder to complete a task.
3. what question do you want to ask? I would like to know a little more about what we are going to study about in this course, specifically the progressions that we'll make as we move on along the year.

#solution to the homework

Here I solved the code challenge

triangle(0,0,40,0,0,50);

triangle(40,50,40,0,0,50);

triangle(40,50,0,50,0,100);

triangle(40,50,0,100,40,100);

triangle(40,100,40,75,80,100);

triangle(40,75,80,100,80,75);
