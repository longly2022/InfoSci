1. what did we do? - We learned about the basic rules of computational thinking and how it could be applied to real life situations.
2. what did you learn? I learned that computers don't process and respond to information the same way as humans, and that you have to make extremely specific commands for the computer to process and follow. This can also be applied to real life, as vague information is unacceptable and unrespectful to others, and makes it harder to complete a task.
3. what question do you want to ask? I would like to know a little more about what we are going to study about in this course, specifically the progressions that we'll make as we move on along the year.

#solution to the homework

Here I solved the code challenge
```.py
triangle(0,0,40,0,0,50);
triangle(40,50,40,0,0,50);
triangle(40,50,0,50,0,100);
triangle(40,50,0,100,40,100);
triangle(40,100,40,75,80,100);
triangle(40,75,80,100,80,75);

1. What did we do? - We did a few commands on how to create different shapes and line between them, as well as how to randomize/make shapes appear as we want, or under a certain amount of time.
2. What did you learn? - I learned that attention to details is very important when doing commands, and that you can modify shapes, their sizes, colors, lines between the shapes.
3. What question do you want to ask? - I would like to ask how we can modify the amount of circles to our own command, like rolling a dice randomly, but the shapes get in a designated place.

1. What did we do? - We created random amounts of shapes on a designated location, rendering it possible to make a dice and randomize it. We also learned about chance bias, basically making one number more likely to appear than another. We played a game where we had to guess it.
2. What did you learn? - We learned about utilizing the random command to randomize the number of circles but also giving a location to make the circles stay in 1 designed place. We learned about how to make the probability of making 1 number more likely to appear than others.
3. What question do you want to ask? I would like to ask about how to fill color only to the shapes that I want to, for example only filling the circles inside the square but not the square itself.
